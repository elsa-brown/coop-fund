			<h5 class="top-heading anchor-100px">Purpose</h5>
			<p>
			The purpose of Coop Fund is to
				<ul id="purpose-ul">
					<li>
						Generate resources and discussion with individuals and/or collectives who want to formalize their working practices.
					</li>
					<li>
						Recognize members have individual needs and that these needs affect one's ability to participate in collective work.
					</li>
					<li>
						Support proposals that struggle to get support elsewhere.
					</li>
					<li>
						Resist the current forms of investor owned, corporate, for-profit business models that dominate most areas of life, and bring into question the non-profit model and its over reliance on wealthy elites.
					</li>
					<li 
						class="anchor-50px" 
						id="community-ref">
							Address inequitable wealth distribution and the causes of injustice and inequality in our <a href="#community">community</a> through solidarity and discussion.
					</li>
					<li>
						Work in the field of cultural production. We don’t see this field as exceptional, or exempt from the need to develop structural change in regard to wealth distribution and democratic work practices. In fact, we know that this field is highly unregulated, exploitative, and exclusionary at all levels.
					</li>
				</ul>

			<h5>History and Current Format</h5>
			<p>
				In the beginning of 2017, as part of <a href="http://artistsspace.org/exhibitions/authorization-sessions" target="_blank">Authorization Sessions</a> at Artists Space, Emma Hedditch organized an eight week Cooperative Study Discussion Course with Artists Space staff members Rachel Peddersen, Harry Burke, Colleen O’Connor and Jamie Stevens.

				Greer Dworman, Tess Dworman, Michelle Coffey, Richard Birkett, and Laurel Atwell participated in some of these sessions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Following this course Emma conducted further research into cooperative organizations in Edinburgh, with <a href="http://www.rhubaba.org" target="_blank">Rhubaba Gallery</a>, and <a href="https://www.theshowroom.org" target="_blank">The Showroom</a> in London.
			</p>
			<p>
					In August 2017, Emma joined with Lydia Okrent and Elsa Brown in New York and together they started to work on the development of an online and in person cooperative funding platform, Coop Fund.

					What Is A Cooperative?
			</h5>
			<p>
				A cooperative is an organization in which ownership and decision making are distributed democratically between all members.

					The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Co-operative_Alliance">International Co-operative Alliance (ICA)</a> defines a cooperative as, <span class="italic">"an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and <a href="#democratic">democratically-controlled</a> enterprise."</span>
