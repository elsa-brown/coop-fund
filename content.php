			<h5>About</h5>
			<p>
				This project is in resistance to accepting the current limited forms of investor owned, corporate, for profit business models that dominate most areas of life, and it brings into question the non-profit model and it’s over reliance on wealthy elites.
			</p>
			<p>
				We recognise that we are working in the field of cultural production, but we don’t see this field as exceptional or exempt from the need to develop ideas for structural change when it comes to wealth distribution and democratic work practices. In fact we know that this field is highly unregulated, exploitative and exclusionary at all levels.
			</p>
			<h5>History and Current Format</h5>
			<p>
				In the beginning of 2017, as part of <a href="http://artistsspace.org/exhibitions/authorization-sessions">Authorization Sessions</a> at Artists Space, Emma Hedditch organized an eight week Cooperative Study Discussion Course with Artists Space staff members Rachel Peddersen, Harry Burke, Colleen O’Connor and Jamie Stevens, and were joined for some of the sessions by Greer Dworman, Tess Dworman, Michelle Coffey, Richard Birkett, and Laurel Atwell.
			</p>
			<p>
				Following this course and further research into cooperative organization in Edinburgh, with Rhubaba Gallery and The Showroom in London. In August 2017 Emma joined with Lydia Okrent and Elsa Brown in NY and together they started to work on the administration of an online and in person cooperative funding platform, Coop Fund.

			<h5>What Is A Cooperative?</h5>
			<p>
				"A cooperative is an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise."<br /><span class="small">- International Cooperative Alliance Statement on Cooperative Identity</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				Cooperatives are based on the values of
				<ul>
					<li>self-help,</li> 
					<li>self-responsibility,</li>
					<li>democracy,</li>
					<li>equality,</li>
					<li>equity,</li>
					<li>and solidarity.</li>
				</ul>
				In the tradition of their founders, cooperative members believe in the ethical values of honesty, openness, social responsibility, and caring for others.
